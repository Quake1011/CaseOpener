# A simple version of opening cases
***The plugin is a case model spawner that starts a timer before creating an entity simulating a reward. As a reward, you can set VIP groups, a random number of credits and experience.***
[^1]: It is a standalone plugin, on the basis of which I am currently writing a private(maybe public) CORE equal to WSGK.

## Requirements
 - [CSGO Colors](https://hlmod.ru/threads/inc-cs-go-colors.46870/)
 - [Levels Ranks](https://github.com/levelsranks/levels-ranks-core/tree/3.1.7B2) (optional)
 - [Shop](https://github.com/hlmod/Shop-Core)
 - [VIP Core](https://github.com/R1KO/VIP-Core/releases) (optional)
 - [FPS](https://github.com/OkyHp/Fire-Players-Stats) (optional)
 - *>=* SM 1.10
 - MYSQL | SQLITE

## Setup
1) Move all files according to the current directories. 
2) Add **"case_opener"** section in configuration file **addons/sourcemod/configs/database.cfg**:
```
"case_opener"
{
  "driver"      "mysql"
  "host"	"255.255.255.255"
  "database"	"dbname"
  "user"	"dbuser"
  "pass"	"password"
}
```
3) To configure **CaseOpener.cfg** for yourself in the source code before compilation or after file generation
4) To configure **Opener.ini** if you need 
5) Depends by the statistics plugin on the server - delete the **lvl_ranks.inc** or **FirePlayersStats.inc** library from the **addons/sourcemod/scripting/include** folder. If dont use these plugins for statistics you should delete both libraries
6) Compile **Case Opener.sp** and move it to the **plugins** folder.
7) Restart a server
